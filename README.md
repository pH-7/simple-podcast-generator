## :mag_right: Summary

### Host your podcast files and generate the RSS Podcast feed

A simple PHP script that reads your MP3/M4A audio files to generate an elegant RSS2 feed to be then published to podcast
platforms.

## :hammer: Requirements

* [PHP 8+](https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/en.php) 🐘

## :building_construction: Installation

1. Place your podcast audio files (mp3, m4a, ...) in `web/audio-files` directory.
2. Add a txt file with the same name as your audio file but with `.meta.txt` as extension (without the `mp3` or `ma4` audio extension). Inside, add a description of your audio podcast.
3. Edit the `config.ini` file with your favorite text editor:
   1. Change `url` to your URL of where it will be installed.
   2. Change `podcast.name` to the name of your podcast.
   3. Update `podcast.description` to a generic description of your podcast.
4. Load the page and specify the generated RSS feed to the different podcast platforms 🚀
